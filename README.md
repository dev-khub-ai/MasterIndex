# khub.ai Project goals

## Long-term goal: build an open-source Knowledge Hub based on the Generative AI technology. 

We envision that any human with expertise in some areas can come to chat with AI bots with the intention of persisting and sharing his/her knowledge, and such knowledge can also be used for building larger systems. You can think of this K-Hub community as the GenAI versions of the facebook and github sites, where LLMs/VLMs are the new CPUs, GenAI bots are the new software applications, and both bots, people, and organizations are the users.

## Mid-term goal: perfect the inference-time learning methodology for GenAI

We believe that in order to build deeply vertical GenAI applications with specific expertise, i.e., the modern-day Expert Systems, GenAI model training and fine-tuning can only get us there part of the way. This is because real-world problem domains tend to have long-tail distribution which results in endless edge cases that are too expensive to handle with constant model fine-tuning. As such we need a learning methodology that allows a AI chatbot to learn instantly, incrementally, and interactively as it commninicates with the user. We also call this the i3-learning. Some also call this TTT (Test-time training). 

## Near-term goals

We plan to prove and perfect our inference-time learning methodology in multiple directions:

- One-shot/few-shot image classification.
- Solving the ARC-AGI-v2 puzzles, where the system needs to learn how to find solutions that conform to human intuition.
- A minimal Jarvis smart agent that customizes itself to user's behavioral patterns instanly.
- Robotic adaptability, reasoning, and problem solving.
- ...and many other problem domains that need to capture human nature by learning and interacting with humans closely.
